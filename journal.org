The command for angular build should be
#+begin_src sh
ng build --prod --output-path cordova/www/ --base-href /www/
#+end_src
Now, I'm facing two problems.
1. how to debug it since it has been uglify?

Following [[https://www.becompany.ch/en/blog/2016/10/19/creating-apache-cordova-app-with-angular2][this article]], we can make an angular with cordova.
#+begin_src sh
ng new cordova-ng-test
cd cordova-ng-test
cordova create cordova
#+end_src
